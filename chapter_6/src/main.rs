    // Chapter 6 - Enums and Patter Matching

    // Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants
    // Chapter objectives:
    // define and show how an enum can encode meaning along with data
    // explore the enum Option, which expresses a value can be either something or nothing
    // look at pattern matching with the match expression and how it makes it easy to run different code for different values of an enum
    // cover how the if let construct is another convenient and concise idiom avialable to handle enums
